## ?? RECON AGENT DEEP DIVE
**"The Boots on the Ground Perspective"**

### 1. The "Private Adventure" Pivot
Switching the CTA to **"Book A Private Party"** and **"Book A No Limits Adventure"** is a strategic masterstroke.
*   **Why it works:** Zante tourists (especially groups) crave *exclusivity*. They don't just want a ticket; they want the VIP treatment. "Private Adventure" implies a curated, high-ticket experience (boat parties, private villa raves, hidden beach spots).
*   **The Gap:** We need to define what an "Adventure" actually is in the backend. Is it a package? A tour?
*   **Recommendation:** Ensure the AI Agent has a script ready when someone clicks that button. It should ask: "How big is your squad?" and "What's your budget per head?" immediately.

### 2. Real Assets vs. Stock
Using the real `Flavors - Blue Lagoon` and `Flavors Sign` images will increase trust by 100%.
*   **Observation:** Stock photos look "too clean". The real photos (even if slightly gritty) show *actual* vibes.
*   **Action:** The "Moments" section needs to be flooded with real customer faces. That's the social proof engine.

## ?? CREATIVE DIRECTOR FEEDBACK
**"The Visionary Perspective"**

### 1. Visual Consistency
*   **Critique:** The "Fire & Ice" theme is strong, but ensure the *real* images match this. The branded cocktail images have backgrounds—make sure they don't clash with the dark charcoal cards.
*   **Fix:** In GHL, use the "Image Radius" setting to round the corners of the uploaded cocktail images to match the card border-radius (20px).

### 2. The "No Limits" Section
*   **Vibe Check:** This section needs to feel *dangerous* (in a fun way).
*   **Idea:** When we get the real video montage, apply a "Glitch" effect or a high-contrast filter. It shouldn't look like a corporate promo; it should look like a leaked party tape.

### 3. Typography
*   **Note:** The `Bebas Neue` headers are perfect. Keep them HUGE. On mobile, ensure "FIRE MEETS ICE" doesn't break onto 3 lines awkwardly.

## ?? CAI (COUNCIL OF AI) RECOMMENDATIONS
**"The Technical & Strategic Perspective"**

### 1. WhatsApp Booking Logic
The new buttons link to:
*   `text=I want to book a Flavors Private Party`
*   `text=I want to book a No Limits Private Adventure`

**Directive:** You MUST configure the AI Agent (in GHL Conversation AI) to recognize these *exact phrases* as triggers.
*   **Trigger:** "Private Party" -> **Action:** Start "Party Planner Mode" (Ask Date, Pax, Occasion).
*   **Trigger:** "Private Adventure" -> **Action:** Start "Concierge Mode" (Ask Vibe, Budget, Duration).

### 2. The "Moments" Upload Loop
*   **Tech Stack:** The "Upload Your Moment" button currently does nothing.
*   **Fix:** Create a GHL Form ("Photo Contest"). Link the button to a popup with this form.
*   **Incentive:** Auto-reply with a "Spin & Win" link for anyone who uploads a photo. This closes the loop and brings them back to the bar.

### 3. Franchise Data Collection
*   **Strategy:** The "Download Investor Pack" button is a high-value lead magnet.
*   **Requirement:** Do NOT give the PDF away for free. Link it to a GHL Form (Name, Email, Phone, Investment Budget). *Then* email them the PDF. These are your €50k+ leads.
