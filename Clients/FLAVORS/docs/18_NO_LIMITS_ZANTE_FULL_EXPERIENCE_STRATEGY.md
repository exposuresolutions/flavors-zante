## ?? PART 1: COMPETITIVE RECON - ZANTE EVENT MANAGEMENT LANDSCAPE

### Known Competitors in Zante

| Company | Focus | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| **Zante Events** | Club nights, boat parties | Established brand, venue partnerships | Generic experience, no personalization |
| **Party Hard Travel** | Package holidays + events | UK market penetration | Cookie-cutter packages, mass tourism feel |
| **Club Reps Zante** | Wristband packages | Budget-friendly, volume | Low-quality service, no VIP feel |
| **Zante Booze Cruise** | Boat parties | Cheap, popular | Trashy reputation, no class |
| **Fantasy Boat Party** | Premium boat events | Good branding | Limited to one experience |

### Market Gap Analysis

**What's MISSING in Zante:**
1. ? **Personalized concierge service** - Everyone gets the same generic package
2. ? **Multi-generational appeal** - Only targeting 18-25 year olds
3. ? **AI-powered matching** - No tech innovation
4. ? **Quality over quantity** - Race to the bottom on price
5. ? **Full-trip management** - Just events, not the whole experience
6. ? **CRM & loyalty** - No relationship building
7. ? **Hen/Stag specialist** - Generic party planning
