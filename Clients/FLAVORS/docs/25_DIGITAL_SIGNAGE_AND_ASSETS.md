## ?? 4. NLZ LOGO DECISION MATRIX
*Recommendation based on "Class & Elegance" vision.*

We have 5 options. Based on the new direction (Premium, VIP, Multi-generational), here is the selection criteria:

| Style | Verdict | Why? |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Neon / Glitch / Cyberpunk** | ? **REJECT** | Too "teenager", too "Magaluf 2010". |
| **Graffiti / Street** | ? **REJECT** | Too casual, clashes with "Elegance". |
| **Gold / Crown / Crest** | ? **WINNER** | Fits "The Queen", "VIP", "Gold Member". |
| **Minimalist / Typography** | ? **BACKUP** | Good for merchandise, but maybe too boring for a club. |

**Recommendation:** Go with the **Gold/Crown** style logo. It bridges the gap between "Party" and "Premium". It looks good on a VIP card and a champagne bottle.

---

## ?? 5. LOGO REFINEMENT (CAPCUT PROMPT)
*To finalize the Gold/Crown logo and ensure the text is perfect.*

**Selected Style:** The Gold Crown / Shield Emblem.

**CapCut / AI Prompt to Generate/Refine:**
> "Luxury nightlife logo design, centered 3D metallic gold crown, bold premium letters 'NLZ' in the middle, elegant shield crest outline in gold, black background. Text below in elegant serif font: 'NO LIMITS ZANTE'. Signature script text at very bottom in glowing pink or gold: 'Experience by Natasha'. Cinematic lighting, 8k resolution, high end club branding."
